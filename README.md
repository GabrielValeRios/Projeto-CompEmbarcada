# Reps

## Reps é um projeto da matéria Computação Embarcada, 5º Semestre Engenharia da Computação,Insper.

  Although Insper's computer engineering course is recent , it already contains innovative courses, that instigate the technical        development next to the entrepreneurship. Thus, the Embedded Computing course, 5th semester, planned a project to address such competences: 

The aim of the project is to improve the optimization and to understand the operation of the Atmel SAME70 board. From this focus, students Gabriel Rios and Gabriela Almeida will develop an Automatic Repetition Counter, aimed at its use in gyms. The main idea is to get a user who regularly trains and improve his performance through a device that counts automatically how many repetitions he has already performed, while verifying that the repetition was valid. In this way, the user can think of other subjects when performing the exercise.
